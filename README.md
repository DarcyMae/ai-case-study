## Overview and Origin  ##

* **Name of Company**
    Suki.AI

* **When was the company incorporated:**
    Suki.AI was founded in 2017 

* **Who are the founders of the company?**
    Punit Soni is the founder and CEO of Suki.AI. He was previously the chief product officer at Flipkart, the vice president on product management with Motorola Mobility, and a lead product manager at Google. 

* **How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**
    A 2018 [Survey of America's Physicians](https://physiciansfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/physicians-survey-results-final-2018.pdf) showed that 80% of physicians are at full capacity or are overextended and 49% would not recommend their career to their children. This is usually attributed to a poor work life balance leading to burnout. Suki.AI was designed with the desire to help with Clinician burnout. It does that by utalizing an AI-powered solution to streamline processed and alleviate the administrative burdan on healthcare providers. Suki’s mission is to “make healthcare tech invisible and assistive so that clinicians can focus on patient care.”
